# Bharat

This is an original ReactJS project about India. I had this idea because I like world cultures and history. I used React + NextJS and styled it with TailwindCSS. I connected it to an API made by myself with NodeJS and Axios to get the data of the sections "Home", "History" and "Languages". I tested it with Postman. I used Firebase to store the users information. I deployed it on Vercel.

This website is completely interactive, so you can click on any image and get to see a window with iformation about it. All the buttons have a function as well, like the ones in the "Languages" section where you can filter by language families. You can sign up using your Google account or with an email and password (since this is a personal project I don't require verification, so you can invent any email and password that you want), then you can sign in with your chosen method to access the protected route of your Account page.
