# Bharat

Bharat is a **fully original web application** built to present the history, languages, symbolism, and cultural identity of India through a modern, interactive, and scalable web architecture.

This project was **designed, architected, and implemented from scratch** as a portfolio-grade application, focusing on clean UI composition, dynamic data consumption, authentication flows, and responsive behavior across devices.

## ✨ Project Overview

Bharat is not a template, clone, or tutorial follow-along project.

It is a **custom-designed platform** that combines:

- Structured content served via APIs
- A modern frontend architecture using Next.js
- User authentication and protected routes
- A responsive, mobile-first UI
- Interactive components such as sliders and dynamic sections

The project emphasizes **clarity of domain**, **scalability**, and **production-ready patterns**.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📚 **Dynamic cultural and historical content**
- 🔐 **Authentication with protected routes**
- 🧭 **Responsive navigation with mobile menu**
- 🖼️ **Interactive image slider**
- ⚡ **Client-side data fetching with loading skeletons**
- 📱 **Fully responsive design** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- 🎨 **Consistent UI theming and layout system**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

| Category | Technology |
|----------|-----------|
| **Framework** | Next.js (App Router) |
| **Language** | JavaScript (ES6+) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS |
| **Authentication** | Firebase Authentication |

## 🧩 Architecture Notes

- The application follows a **component-driven architecture**
- Content is **decoupled from the UI** and consumed via APIs
- Authentication logic is centralized using a custom `AuthContext`
- Protected routes are enforced client-side
- UI components are reusable and domain-oriented
- Layout decisions prioritize scalability and maintainability

---

## 🔐 Authentication & Protected Routes

- Users can sign in and sign out using Firebase Authentication
- Certain routes are restricted to authenticated users
- Redirection logic ensures unauthorized access is prevented
- Session state is handled via React Context

## 📁 Project Structure

```
app/
 ├─ components/
 ├─ context/
 ├─ protected/
 ├─ pages/
 └─ layout.js

```

The structure is intentionally simple and explicit to keep domain logic clear and readable.

## 🧪 Code Quality & Standards

- Clear component responsibilities
- Predictable state handling
- Consistent naming conventions
- No autogenerated boilerplate logic
- No copy-pasted UI kits or templates

This repository reflects **intentional design decisions**, not experimental code.

---

## 📌 Originality Statement

This project is **100% original**.

- No starter templates were used
- No UI kits were copied
- No tutorial projects were followed
- All components, layouts, and logic were independently designed and implemented

Bharat was built as a **serious portfolio project**, intended to demonstrate real-world frontend architecture and engineering judgment.
