    p1: "The Bronze Age in the Indian subcontinent began around 3300 BCE. The Indus Valley was one of the three major cradles of Old World civilization, with a population possibly exceeding five million at its peak. The Indus civilization was primarily centered in modern-day Pakistan's Indus river basin and the Ghaggar-Hakra basin. It flourished from 2600 to 1900 BCE, marking the rise of urban life in the Indian subcontinent. Major cities included Harappa, Mohenjo-daro (Pakistan), and Dholavira, Lothal (India).",
    p2: 'During the 2nd millennium BCE, the Ochre Coloured Pottery culture thrived in the Ganga-Yamuna Doab region. These rural settlements practiced agriculture, hunting, and used copper tools like axes, spears, arrows, and swords, along with domesticated animals.',

    p1: 'In both North and South India, iron use began early. Radiocarbon dating in Uttar Pradesh dates iron artifacts to between 1800 and 1000 BCE, particularly in the Central Ganga Plain and Eastern Vindhyas. This period coincides with the migration of later Vedic people, who influenced material culture. New findings suggest India independently developed ironworking.',
    p2: 'In South India, recent discoveries in Mayiladumparai, dated to 2172 BCE, point to even earlier iron use. Sites like Hallur in Karnataka and Adichanallur in Tamil Nadu also show evidence of ironworking around 1000 BCE.',

    p1: "The Classical period in India, spanning from around 200 BCE to 650 CE, was a time of immense cultural, intellectual, and political development. This era began with the decline of the Maurya Empire and saw the rise of several regional powers, including the Satavahanas and the Kushans. It was during this period that significant advancements in art, literature, and philosophy took place, particularly under the patronage of rulers like the Gupta dynasty. Sanskrit literature flourished, with foundational texts like the 'Mahabharata' and the 'Ramayana' being finalized, while classical Hinduism and early forms of Buddhism and Jainism thrived.",
    p2: "Politically, the Gupta Empire, often referred to as the 'Golden Age' of India, dominated much of northern India from the 4th to 6th centuries. The Guptas fostered advancements in science, mathematics, and astronomy, with scholars like Aryabhata making significant contributions. Meanwhile, southern India experienced its own cultural growth, with the Sangam literature emerging as a hallmark of Tamil culture. The Classical period also saw India's economy prosper through extensive trade networks across Asia and beyond, solidifying its position as a major global center of wealth and cultural exchange.",

    p1: 'The Early Medieval period in India, spanning from the mid-6th century to around 1200 CE, was marked by political fragmentation and the rise of regional kingdoms. After the decline of the Gupta Empire, several smaller dynasties emerged, including the Chalukyas, Pallavas, and Rashtrakutas in the south, and the Gurjara-Pratiharas and Palas in the north. These kingdoms often engaged in warfare, but they also fostered significant cultural and architectural developments, leading to the construction of grand temples and advancements in art. This period also saw the rise of regional languages and literature, with works being produced in Tamil, Kannada, and Sanskrit.',
    p2: "During this time, Hinduism and Buddhism continued to evolve, with Hindu temples becoming prominent centers of learning and culture. However, the decline of Buddhism in India began as it lost royal patronage and influence, particularly in the north. By the end of this period, Islamic invasions, most notably by Mahmud of Ghazni and later Muhammad of Ghor, began to shape the political landscape, setting the stage for the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate in the early 13th century. The Early Medieval period was thus a time of both cultural flourishing and political change, laying the groundwork for India's medieval history.",

    p1: "The Late Medieval period in India, spanning from around 1200 to 1526, was a time of significant political transformation, marked by the rise of Islamic dynasties and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate. This period began with the decline of regional Hindu kingdoms and the consolidation of power under Muslim rulers such as the Mamluks, Khiljis, Tughlaqs, and Lodis. These dynasties controlled much of northern India, influencing the region's architecture, culture, and administration. The introduction of Persian and Central Asian influences reshaped Indian society, particularly in art, language, and governance, as Persian became the court language.",
    p2: 'In southern India, the Vijayanagara Empire emerged as a powerful Hindu kingdom, successfully resisting northern invasions and flourishing as a cultural and economic center. The empire promoted Hinduism, built grand temples, and fostered the development of regional art and literature. This period also witnessed an increase in trade with the Middle East and Southeast Asia, further integrating India into global economic networks. The Late Medieval period ended in 1526 with the defeat of the Lodi dynasty by Babur at the Battle of Panipat, marking the beginning of the Mughal Empire, which would dominate Indian history for centuries to come.',

    p1: "The Early Modern period in India, spanning from 1526 to 1858, was characterized by the rise and dominance of the Mughal Empire, followed by the gradual expansion of European colonial powers. The period began with Babur's victory at the Battle of Panipat in 1526, which established the Mughal dynasty. Under rulers such as Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb, the Mughals consolidated power over much of the Indian subcontinent. This era is known for its architectural marvels, including the Taj Mahal, as well as advancements in art, literature, and administration. The Mughals introduced a centralized administrative system, promoted religious tolerance (especially under Akbar), and fostered a flourishing economy driven by agriculture and trade.",
    p2: 'However, by the 18th century, the Mughal Empire began to decline due to internal conflicts, weak successors, and external pressures from regional powers such as the Marathas, Sikhs, and Rajputs. During this time, European colonial powers, particularly the British and the French, began to expand their influence through trade and military conquest. The British East India Company gradually took control of large parts of India, especially after the Battle of Plassey in 1757. By the mid-19th century, the British had effectively replaced the Mughal Empire as the dominant power in India, leading to the establishment of direct British rule in 1858 after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, marking the end of the Early Modern period and the beginning of the British Raj.',

    p1: "The Late Modern and Contemporary period in India, spanning from 1857 to 1947, was a time of intense political upheaval and social transformation. It began with the Indian Rebellion of 1857, also known as the First War of Independence, which marked the end of the Mughal Empire and the dissolution of the British East India Company's rule. In response to the uprising, the British government established direct control over India, initiating the period known as the British Raj. Under British rule, India experienced both economic exploitation and infrastructural development, with the introduction of railways, telegraphs, and modern education systems, but also faced widespread poverty and famines due to exploitative policies.",
    p2: "This period also witnessed the rise of Indian nationalism, as leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, and Subhas Chandra Bose spearheaded movements for independence. The Indian National Congress, founded in 1885, became a key political force advocating for self-rule, with Gandhi's non-violent resistance and civil disobedience campaigns gaining mass support. Meanwhile, tensions between Hindus and Muslims increased, culminating in calls for a separate Muslim state, which were championed by the All-India Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah. The period ended with India's independence from British rule in 1947, accompanied by the tragic partition of India and Pakistan, which resulted in large-scale violence and displacement, shaping the future of the subcontinent.",

    section: 'Independence and partition (1947–present)',
    p1: "India's independence in 1947 marked a turning point in its history, but it was accompanied by the traumatic partition of the subcontinent into two nations: India and Pakistan. The partition, driven by religious divisions between Hindus and Muslims, resulted in one of the largest mass migrations in history, with millions of people crossing newly drawn borders. This led to widespread violence, with estimates of hundreds of thousands killed during communal riots. India, under the leadership of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, adopted a secular and democratic constitution, while Pakistan was established as an Islamic republic. The partition also left a lasting legacy of tension between the two nations, particularly over the disputed region of Kashmir, which remains a flashpoint for conflict.",
    p2: "In the years following independence, India focused on nation-building and economic development. Under Nehru's leadership, India pursued a policy of non-alignment during the Cold War, maintaining diplomatic relations with both the Western and Eastern blocs. India also embarked on a series of ambitious economic reforms, with an emphasis on self-sufficiency through industrialization and agrarian reforms. However, challenges such as poverty, population growth, and communal tensions persisted. Over the decades, India has evolved into the world's largest democracy, experiencing rapid economic growth, technological advancements, and social change. It continues to navigate its role as a major global power while addressing internal challenges such as inequality, religious tensions, and environmental issues. The relationship with Pakistan remains complex, marked by periods of conflict and attempts at diplomacy.",
