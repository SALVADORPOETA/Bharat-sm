    p1: "India, officially the Republic of India, is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest by area and the most populous as of June 2023. Since its independence in 1947, it has been the world's most populous democracy. India is bordered by the Indian Ocean to the south, the Arabian Sea to the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal to the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. Nearby in the Indian Ocean are Sri Lanka and the Maldives, with maritime borders shared with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia.",
    p2: 'Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa over 55,000 years ago. Their long isolation as hunter-gatherers made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in genetic diversity. Settled life began in the Indus River basin 9,000 years ago, evolving into the Indus Valley Civilisation by the third millennium BCE. By 1200 BCE, an early form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, spread into India, evidenced today in the hymns of the Rigveda.',

    section: 'Geography',
    p1: 'India lies on the Indian tectonic plate, part of the Indo-Australian Plate. Its geological history began 75 million years ago when the Indian Plate drifted northeast from Gondwana due to seafloor spreading. This movement caused the Tethyan oceanic crust to subduct under the Eurasian Plate, leading to the formation of the Indian Ocean and the uplift of the Himalayas. South of the Himalayas, a trough formed and filled with sediment, creating the Indo-Gangetic Plain. The ancient Aravalli range marks the first appearance of the Indian plate, with the Thar Desert to the west.',
    p2: "India's climate is heavily influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, which drive the summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas block cold Central Asian winds, keeping India warmer than other regions at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert attracts moisture-laden southwest monsoon winds, providing most of the country's rainfall between June and October. India experiences four major climate types: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.",

    section: 'Politics',
    p1: 'India is a parliamentary republic with a multi-party system. It has six recognized national parties, including the Indian National Congress (INC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), along with more than 50 regional parties. The Congress is considered centrist in Indian politics, while the BJP is viewed as right-wing. From 1950, when India became a republic, until the late 1980s, the Congress held a majority in Parliament. Since then, it has increasingly shared the political stage with the BJP and powerful regional parties, often leading to coalition governments at the center.',
    p2: "India is a federation with a parliamentary system governed by the Constitution of India, the country's supreme legal document, making it a constitutional republic. Federalism in India defines the distribution of power between the union and the states. The Constitution, effective from 26 January 1950, originally described India as a 'sovereign, democratic republic' later amended in 1971 to 'a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic.' Traditionally seen as 'quasi-federal' with a strong central government and weaker states, India's system has become more federal since the late 1990s due to political, economic, and social changes.",

    p1: "In 2024, the Indian economy was nominally valued at $3.94 trillion, making it the fifth-largest economy by market exchange rates, and the third-largest, at approximately $15.0 trillion, by purchasing power parity (PPP), according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With an average annual GDP growth rate of 5.8% over the past two decades, including 6.1% in 2011–2012, India is one of the world's fastest-growing economies. However, it ranks 136th globally in nominal GDP per capita and 125th in GDP per capita at PPP.",
    p2: 'Until 1991, Indian governments followed protectionist policies influenced by socialist economics, with widespread state intervention and regulation isolating the economy from the global market. A severe balance of payments crisis in 1991 forced India to liberalize its economy, leading to a shift towards a free-market system, with a focus on foreign trade and direct investment inflows. India has been a member of the World Trade Organization since 1 January 1995.',

From 2001 to 2011, the population grew by 17.64%, compared to a 21.54% increase in the previous decade (1991–2001). The 2011 census recorded a human sex ratio of 940 females per 1,000 males, and the median age was 28.7 in 2020. The first post-colonial census in 1951 counted 361 million people. Advances in medicine and increased agricultural productivity from the 'Green Revolution' have contributed to India's rapid population growth.",
    p2: 'In India, the life expectancy is 70 years, with women living an average of 71.5 years and men 68.7 years. There are approximately 93 physicians per 100,000 people. Migration from rural to urban areas has been significant in recent years, with the urban population increasing by 31.2% between 1991 and 2001. Despite this, over 70% of the population still lived in rural areas in 2001. Urbanization continued to rise, from 27.81% in the 2001 Census to 31.16% in the 2011 Census.',

    section: 'Art',
    p1: "India has a rich and ancient tradition of art that has interacted with various influences across Eurasia. During the first millennium, Buddhist art spread from India to Central, East, and Southeast Asia, the latter also being significantly influenced by Hindu art. Thousands of seals from the Indus Valley Civilization, dating back to the third millennium BCE, have been discovered. These seals, often carved with animals and occasionally with human figures, include the famous 'Pashupati' seal excavated in Mohenjo-daro, Pakistan, in 1928–29.",
    p2: 'Ancient Indian painting has survived primarily at a few key sites, with the Ajanta Caves being the most notable for their detailed depictions of court life. These paintings, which date back to the Gupta period, reflect a highly developed artistic tradition. Additionally, painted manuscripts of religious texts from Eastern India, starting around the 10th century, provide further evidence of this tradition. The earliest of these manuscripts are Buddhist, followed by Jain works, and their styles likely influenced larger paintings of the time.',

    p1: 'Indian architecture is deeply rooted in the history, culture, and religion of India. It encompasses various styles and traditions, with notable examples including Hindu temple architecture, Indo-Islamic architecture, Rajput architecture, Mughal architecture, South Indian architecture, and Indo-Saracenic architecture. Early Indian architecture was primarily constructed from wood, which did not endure well due to rotting and instability. As a result, the earliest surviving examples of Indian architecture are rock-cut structures, such as Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain temples.',
    p2: "Much of Indian architecture, including the Taj Mahal and other examples of Indo-Islamic Mughal architecture, as well as South Indian architecture, merges ancient local traditions with imported styles. Vernacular architecture also varies regionally in its characteristics. Vastu shastra, meaning 'science of construction' or 'architecture' attributed to Mamuni Mayan, examines how natural laws influence human dwellings. It uses precise geometry and directional alignments to reflect perceived cosmic principles.",

    section: 'Society',
    p1: "Traditional Indian society has often been characterized by social hierarchy, with the Indian caste system representing a significant aspect of social stratification and restrictions on the Indian subcontinent. Social classes are defined by numerous hereditary groups, known as jātis or 'castes.' India abolished untouchability with the adoption of its constitution in 1950 and has since implemented additional anti-discrimination laws and social welfare initiatives.",
    p2: 'Family values are deeply ingrained in Indian tradition, with multi-generational patrilineal joint families being the norm. However, nuclear families are becoming more common in urban areas. A significant majority of Indians have their marriages arranged by their parents or other family elders, with consent from both parties. Marriage is generally considered a lifelong commitment, and the divorce rate is extremely low, with fewer than one in a thousand marriages ending in divorce.',
